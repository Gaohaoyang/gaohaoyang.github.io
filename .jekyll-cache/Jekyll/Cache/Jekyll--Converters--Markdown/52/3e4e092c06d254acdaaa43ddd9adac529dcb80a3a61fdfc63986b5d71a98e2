<p>My girlfriend is learning html and css recently. I told her to follow the video. Here, I recommend a video in Chinese that suite for fresh learners. The name of course is Getting HTML web pages dev in 8 hours ( 8å°æ—¶å­¦ä¼šHTMLç½‘é¡µå¼€å‘ ) . I watched this video at very first time. The teacher named Eighteen Swallows ( ç‡•åå…« ) . He teached very clear even himself being on screen to show what is float or box-model.</p>
