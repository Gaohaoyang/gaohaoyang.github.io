<p>My girlfriend is learning html and css recently. I told her to follow the video. Here, I recommend a video in Chinese that suite for fresh learners. The name of course is Getting HTML web pages dev in 8 hours ( 8å°æ—¶å­¦ä¼šHTMLç½‘é¡µå¼€å‘ ) . I watched this video at very first time. The teacher named Eighteen Swallows ( ç‡•åå…« ) . He teached very clear even himself being on screen to show what is float or box-model.</p>

<p>Here is the site of the free online video.

<p>I did the detailed note about this course. You can read here: <a href="http://wenku.baidu.com/view/aa136099f90f76c660371a35">http://wenku.baidu.com/view/aa136099f90f76c660371a35</a></p>

<p>Now Iâ€™ll tell something happend today. She has watched the video above, and knows a little on BootStrap. So she wants to do some pages with BootStrap.</p>

<p>We determined to copy the pages on <a href="http://zhihu.com">Zhihu</a> <br />
Like this: <br />

<p>I teached her <a href="http://www.bootcss.com/">Boostrap</a> this afternoon. She has already got to read the docs and can code simple statics pages.</p>

<p>She seems to enjoy Web Pages Design. Though she used to be a Graphic Designer. And now, she really works hard.</p>

<p>At last Iâ€™ll show the works that we did together in 2 hours. Itâ€™s unfinished. I guess she will do it later. Itâ€™s a nice weekend, isnâ€™t it?</p>
