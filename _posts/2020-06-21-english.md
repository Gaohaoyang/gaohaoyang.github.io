### 描述上一代生活

【2022-9-23】In China, many grandfathers <span style='color:blue'>save a lot of money</span>（存钱） for their grandchildren. But an old neighbour of mine does not. He always educates his grandchildren to study hard to work hard,  and to be a useful person to the nation in the future.
- My neighbour has a <span style='color:blue'>monthly pension</span>(每月花销) of over 8000 yuan. That is a big sum of money in the eye of many people. But he lives <span style='color:blue'>frugally</span>(/ˈfruːɡəli/, 节约的) in his whole life, and nothing can alter his frugal way of life.
- He must have a big sum of money in his bank account. No, you're wrong. Each time there is a flooding or an eathquake, he will contribute a generous sum of money to people in the disaster area.
- He was a soldier in Mao's time. He looks very old, his face covered with <span style='color:blue'>wrinkles</span>（/ˈrɪŋklz/，皱纹）. Years has changed his face, but not his heart. His heart lives always in that heroic age of China.
- How about his grandchildren? Do they dislike him and hate to see him to give away his money?
- No, they are successful in their studies and careers, they <span style='color:blue'>make money with their own hands and wisdom</span>. They are independent financially and in personality（经济独立、人格独立）.
- He gives his grandchildren the most precious <span style='color:blue'>spiritual wealth</span>, and does not like to change them into <span style='color:blue'>parasites</span>（/ˈpærəˌsaɪt/，寄生虫） with money like many other grandpas do.
- He was a soldier of Mao's time, but today he is still the soldier, nothing changes. If there is a change, it is that he has become a kind grandpa from a <span style='color:blue'>vibrant</span> (/ˈvaɪbrənt/
, 生机勃勃的) young man.

In today's society, more and more people **equate**（/ɪˈkweɪt/等同于） having money **with** success. Money has already become their god.

This afternoon I saw an old man **falling to the ground**（摔倒在地）. I went up to help him to his feet（扶他站起来）. You may think that I was stupid to do so, because I might lose a big sum（金额） of money once I was sued（起诉） for compensation by the old man who **blackmailed**（讹诈） me following an accident in which I was not at fault. Thank you for not hoping me to be the loser.

But I was lucky that this old man recognized me and said thank you to me and told my name directly. I could not recognize him in an instant（立即）. But he told me who he was.

He was Ailing's father. He has become too old to recognize. His daughter, Ailing, used to be a female taxidriver（出租车司机） and owner of three taxis, and rented two taxis out and drove one herself.

That was 25 five years ago when Ailing had three taxis. She was the richest woman I knew in my city at that time.

Then she was making money crazily（拼命挣钱）. She drove her taxi **day and night**（不分昼夜）. She might be the most industrious（/ɪnˈdʌstriəs/勤劳） woman, and at the same time she loved money most.

But one night she did not return home. Her parents had a sense of **foreboding**（/fɔːrˈboʊdɪŋ/
，预感，不祥的）, but they did not dare to tell each other what they thought.

After two months' search for her in the countryside of our city, her **corpse**（/kɔːrps/
，尸体） was found. The police thought that she was robbed and murdered. After months' investigstion, the murderer was caught and sentenced to death（判死刑）.

It is worth mentioning that many relatives and friends went to her funeral（葬礼） and wanted to give the sad father and mother some money, but her parents refused to accept money from anyone.

At the banquet（宴会） in honor of the visitors, her father spoke sadly with tears in his eyes, "... I cannot accept the money you all want to give me and my wife. I must thank you all for your care and kindness. I must say that my daughter loved money too much. At last she lost her life when making money on the road... Do not let money be your God."

10 ways to memorize English words：memorization methods，what ever you learn，speak it out
- number one，learn phrases instead of words，for example，make an appointment，sign a contract，cancel a meeting
- number two，repeat the word 7 to 10 times when you learn，make sure you use it in conversation with your friends or talk to yourself，then use the word one hour later，then one day/week/month later. If you can do this, you should be able to memorize/remember it
- number three, use post-it note. What are post-it notes you say ? Post sticky note all over your house, bathroom, kitchen, bedroom， where ever you can， It is important to create an environment to learn new words。you can even use different colors to organize，verbs，nouns，adjectives， whatever you like。Fool，what does it mean?
- number 4，keep a vocabulary dairy. this is how I learn Chinese, carry a dairy with you in your purse钱包wallet，your backpack，or whatever you want。when you see the new word，write it down，when you have some free time，you can review it on the bus，subway，whatever
- number 5，draw a picture，are you an artist？draw a picture in your dairy help you to remember the new words
- number 6，make word associations，for example，tasty means good to eat or delicious， so what words associated with the word tasty？maybe for you is hotpot or barbecue烧烤，or for Americans maybe it's French fries or ice cream，here is an example：
  - medicine，coffee，tea：bitter；
  - cake，icecream，cookie：sweet
- number 7，write 3 sentences using the word in context上下文。speak the sentences out loud to practice your English and use the new words，you can use the websites，such as 海词 ，to see the word in the context
- number 8，limit how many words you study each day，3-5 is OK，but 10 should be your maximum。think about it，10 words a day is 3650 in one year，that's a lot，not many people can do it，but if you can do it，then I say GO FOR IT！加油
- number 9，learn related words，for example，care，careful，care free，take care，for this，we use what‘s called thesaurus词库，there are many good and free thesaurus APPs for Androids/iOS
- the last one，the thing that helped me most，flashcard单词卡，you can write them and review them when you have free time or you can download an APP，such as flashcards by dictionary.com ，there is a lot of free APP，just go to your APP store，and type in flashcards，or try this methods。review your flashcards once a day，put the word you get correct into one pile（一堆），keep the words you got wrong to try again tomorrow。Do this each day until you have 4 piles，after you got correct 4 times，it can be removed from all the piles

## 看书

【2022-9-24】[Is listening to a book better than reading it?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/chinese/features/take-away-english/ep-220711) 听书比看书更好吗？

一般来说，任何一种阅读方式都会同时用到大脑的几个区域。读纸质书可以帮助你更好地记住信息，听有声读物可能会帮助你在听到叙述者的情绪时培养同理心。本文讨论看书和听书各自的优势。

词汇：reading 阅读

Picture yourself sitting at home in a quiet **reading nook**(读书角,nook角落，旮旯), ignoring the world around you, **engrossed**（/ɪnˈɡroʊst/全神贯注的，专心致志的） in a tale（故事，传说）. You read the **blurb**（/blɜːrb/，内容简介）, instantly became **intrigued**（/ɪnˈtriːɡ/，激起好奇心、兴趣） and now you’re in the middle of an absolute **page-turner**（引人入胜的书）. But, there’s a hot debate – physical books vs. e-books（电子书） vs. audiobooks（有声书籍）. Does the device you’re using to read affect your reaction to the book?

Generally, reading uses several areas of the brain. There’s **attention span**（注意力的持续时间）, reasoning, reading fluency, memory and language comprehension. Reading is known to strengthen communicative ability, vocabulary and increase **emotional intelligence**（情商） and **social perception**（社会知觉）. So, whichever way you’re reading, there are definitely benefits.

But, let’s look at the **pros**（赞成者，例句） to reading with your eyes – that’s physical books and e-books. They can help to retain（记住） information better. This is because when you can actually see the words, your attention is held（注意力集中） more closely. Add to this the fact that with physical books you can go back and find any part you missed, especially if your mind **wander**s（走神，开小差）, which it likely will at some point or other.

On the other hand, there’s the audiobook. Headphones in, you’re switched off from life and the story really **comes alive**（变得有趣，显得逼真）, almost like watching a film – in your head. From a scientific perspective, listening to an audiobook is likely to help you develop a greater sense of empathy as you hear the emotion of the **narrator**（讲述着）. We can more easily understand **inflection**（音调变化） and **intonation**（语调）. Hearing the story engages different parts of the brain, heightening the intensity and **imagery**（意象，比喻）, making you enjoy it more. Yet, going back to attention span, with an audiobook it’s true that it’s much harder to go back and listen again.

All in all, it seems that there are advantages to both physical books and audiobooks. Perhaps, next time you find yourself browsing bookshop **shelves**（书架）, also consider the format. It may just change your whole literary（文学的） experience.

测验与练习
1. 阅读课文并回答问题。
1. What benefits are mentioned in relation to reading in general?
2. Why does reading a physical book help to retain information better?
3. True or false? You feel more empathy towards a character if you read a physical book.
4. Why is it easier to lose focus in an audiobook?
5. Why can listening to a book help you enjoy it more?

## 出行

【2022-9-24】如何描述下车？不是put off，而是

### 骑行

【2022-9-24】[The growing popularity of cycling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/chinese/features/take-away-english/ep-220502) 骑车出行再度兴起

随着共享单车的出现和普及，似乎有越来越多的人开始选择骑车出行。在一些城市中，骑行文化逐渐兴起。这是为什么？除了锻炼身体以外，骑车还有哪些好处？听 “随身英语” 节目围绕骑自行车的益处展开讨论。

词汇: cycling 骑车

They say once you learn how to **ride a bike**（骑自行车）, you never forget. Most of us learnt when we were kids, and many still **strap on our helmets**（系好头盔）, put our feet on the **pedals**（/ˈpedlz/，踏板）, and **shoot off**（发射，击落，出发） for a ride around the streets. In recent times, cycling（骑自行车） has seen a boost（促进，推广） in popularity, so the question is, what makes it so **appealing**（吸引人的） to people to **straddle**（/ˈstrædl/，跨坐） their bikes once again?
- First, let’s look at the health benefits. Cycling can improve your **cardiovascular**（/ˌkɑːrdioʊˈvæskjələr/，心血管） health and burn excess **body fat**（体脂）. Strengthening your leg muscles in your **calves**（/kævz/，小腿） and **thighs**（/θaɪz/，大腿） helps to increase your potential **torque**（/tɔːrk/，扭转力） and **cadence**（/ˈkeɪd(ə)ns/，节奏，节拍）. And cycling’s benefits aren’t just physical（身体上的）, but mental（心理上的，精神上） as well. A long ride in the countryside could help you to **clear your mind**（清理杂念）, or de-stress（放松减压）. But it’s not only about your body and mind – there are also some plus sides for your wallet’s health.
- Cycling can be a great way to commute（通勤） or **get about town**（城市四处走访，get about出行）. By cycling, you save money on fuel（燃料） or train fares（火车票价）. If you do drive into work, sometimes finding somewhere to park（停车） can be a **nightmare**（噩梦）, whereas finding somewhere to **chain** your bike **up**（把自行车锁住） can be much simpler. Then, on the train, there are changes at stations and other commuters speaking loudly on their phones to deal with. Cyclists face neither of these issues. And if you’re worried about safety, there are **designated**（/ˈdezɪɡneɪtɪd/，指定的） cycle lanes（自行车道） in many major cities. Wearing high-visibility（高能见度） clothing, sometimes referred to as ‘hi-vis’, is another way to improve your safety when cycling on the roads.
- Finally, cycling can also be good for the environment. It can help you to reduce your **carbon footprint**（碳排放量，碳足迹）. Not pumping（抽空，排出） out **fumes**（fjuːmz，烟气） into the atmosphere is better for the planet and your own environment.

So, whether people want to cycle for their health, getting about town, their wallet, the environment, or a combination of all of them – the popularity of cycling is on the rise.

1. What health benefits are mentioned in relation to cycling?
2. What can strengthening your leg muscles through cycling lead to?
3. What can cycling help you to save money on?
4. What issues related to train travel are mentioned?
5. Why is cycling good for the environment?

### 如何学机器学习？

【2022-4-9】作者：吴恩达, [链接](https://www.zhihu.com/question/266291909/answer/2429781356)

Do you want to become an AI professional? The key to machine learning mastery is to approach your learning systematically!  
- Machine learning is the science of making a computer perform work without explicit programming.  In the past decade, machine learning has enabled utilities such as **self-driving cars** 自动驾驶, **real-time speech recognition** 实时语音识别, efficient web search 网络搜索, and boosting our knowledge of the human genome 人类基因组. 
- Many researchers believe that machine learning promises the greatest possibility in realizing **human-level AI**. 
- Here, I‘d like to share **three steps** to learn machine learning in a systematic way: 
- First, you should learn **coding basics** 编程基础. 
- Second, you should study machine learning and deep learning. 
- Third, you should focus on the **role** you would like to have.  

Fundamental programming skills are a prerequisite for building machine learning systems. You will need to be able to write a simple computer program (function calls 函数调用, for loops 循环, conditional statements 条件语句, basic mathematical operations 基础数学操作) before you can start implementing preliminary machine learning algorithms. 

Knowing more math can give you an edge, but it won’t be necessary to spend much time on specific mathematical issues such as linear algebra, probability and statistics. 

Having gained some fundamental coding skills, you can officially begin your journey of machine learning. My Machine Learning course from Stanford University is a great choice. It provides a general introduction to **machine learning**, **data mining**, and the statistical approach of **pattern recognition**. The course will also help you to develop your practical understanding of how to use machine learning in the **real world**. For instance, when to use supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and machine learning.  The machine learning course draws insights from （洞察力） numerous case studies and applications. It is suitable for learning how to apply algorithms to a wide-variety of tasks, such as **intelligent robots** building (perception, control), natural language understanding NLU领域 (web search, anti-spam emails), **computer vision** (identifying diseases in medical imagery, finding defects in manufacturing), and much more. 

Deep learning is a subset 子集 of machine learning that is growing more important, and is worth your attention as well. It uses neural networks to make powerful predictions, and is the driving force behind many of today’s most exciting technologies. For example, self-driving cars, advanced web search, and face recognition all use deep learning. The Deep Learning Specialization, developed by DeepLearning.AI, covers the knowledge you need to build deep learning applications in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. You will conduct **case studies** 案例分析 in healthcare, **autonomous driving**, **sign language reading** 收拾语言理解, **music creation** 音乐创作, and natural language processing NLP领域, so you can familiarize yourself with the practical application of deep learning in various industries while mastering theoretical knowledge 理论知识 at the same time. 

Once you have learned the foundations of machine learning and deep learning, the next move depends on the role you have in mind. For example, do you want to be a **data scientist** 数据科学家,  **engineer** 工程师, or machine learning researcher? 研究院 Or, do you consider developing AI skills to complement your existing expertise? If so, you can learn AI as a way to better apply your expertise to real-world problems. 

After deciding the role, it's time to move on to real practice. You’ll want to get experience working on projects 项目经验 and as a part of a team 团队协作. Identifying viable 可行的 and valuable 有价值的 projects is an important skill, and it’s one that you’ll continue to develop throughout your career. The best way to start is to volunteer to help with other peoples’ projects. Eventually 最终 you will develop the confidence and experience to **lead your own** 独当一面. 

For completing a project, **teamwork** is more likely to succeed than **solo** effort 单打独斗. It is critical to have the ability to collaborate with others, give and take advice, as this helps you build connections. Teamwork also helps you build out your network of professional connections. You can call on people who you have worked with in the past to provide advice and support as you move through your career.  

The ultimate goal 终极目标, of course, is to find a job in machine learning. This will come after you have acquired both **theoretical knowledge** 理论知识 as well as **practical experience** 实际经验. When looking for a job, don’t be shy about reaching out to people you have met while taking courses or working on projects. You can also connect directly with professionals who are already working in the field. Many of them are happy to **act as your mentor**.  

Finding your first job, however, is a small step in a long-term career 职业生涯. It is important to cultivate **self-discipline** 自律 and commit to **constant learning** 持续学习. People around you may not be able to tell whether you spend your weekends studying or on your smartphone, but day by day, and year over year, it will make a difference. Discipline ensures that you move forward while staying healthy. 

I hope these suggestions could open the door to machine learning and help get you job-ready. The journey ahead will surely be a bumpy （ˈbʌmpi] 曲折的）one, but rest assured that what you encounter along the way will help you succeed. By the way, courses from DeepLearning.AI will be available on Zhihu soon. **Stay tuned** 敬请 and see you next time! Keep Learning! Andrew

### 996

【2022-6-4】

There are 996,361,35 age limit rules .
- `996` means working 9am to 9pm,6 days a week .
- `361` means that there is a performance 
 evaluation every six months , the top 30% of employees are good ,60% are normal , and 
10% are likely to be fired . 
- The `35-year-old` age limit means that when you are 35 years old , the company wil think that your career is going down , and you may be fired because of your age .

[996.ICU](https://996.icu/#/en_US)

What is "996"?
- A "996" work schedule refers to an unofficial work schedule (9 am - 9 pm, 6 days a week) that has been gaining more popularity. Serving a company that encourages the "996" work schedule usually means work for at least 60 hours a week.

Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China 劳动法
- Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China Article 41 says:
  - The employer can prolong\[prəˈlɑːŋ]延长 work hours due to needs of production or businesses after consultation\[,kɑnsl'teʃən]咨询/磋商 with its trade union 工会 and laborers. The work hours to be prolonged, in general, shall be no longer than one hour a day, or no more than three hours a day if such prolonging is called for due to special reasons and under the condition that the physical health of laborers is guaranteed. The work time to be prolonged shall not exceed, however, 36 hours a month.

Gaining more popularity and publicity \[pʌb'lɪsəti] 宣传、公开、注意
- In early 2019, a Chinese E-commerce company called Youzan announced the **adoption** of the "996" work schedule in the future, at the company's `Chinese New Year Party` 年会. The CEO of Youzan responded: "This would definitely be a good decision when we look back in a few years time.".
- In Mid-March 2019, it was reported that Jingdong started adopting "996" or "995" work schedule in some of the business units. Jingdong PR posted on their maimai(脉脉, a Chinese **real-name** business social network platform) account: "(Our culture is) to devote ourselves with all our hearts (to achieve the business objectives)".
- Although it is gaining more publicity recently, this work scheudle is a commonly known "secret" practiced in a lot of companies in China.

**Compensation** \[,kɑmpɛn'seʃən]补偿、赔偿 and benefits
- According to the Labor Law, employees who follow the "996" work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under "996" rarely get paid that much.

Where does the name of the repo 996.ICU come from?
- If you consistently\[kən'sɪstəntli]一贯的、一致的 follow the "996" work schedule, you run the risk of getting yourself into Intensive Care Unit.
Developers' lives matter.

Contribution
- Any merged modification to all files will be rendered as github flavored markdown and published on the site regularly.
- Feel free to adjust the format, add some content or fix grammatical errors.

Expand influence
- I18n support is ongoing.
- If you would like to contribute, you can add translations or just write something down in other languages in separate files.
- The key is to make ourselves heard and raise public awareness of working hours violations违反违规 in the workplace of software developers.

【2019-04-25】
Work-life balance is not one size fits all一刀切. It looks different for everyone因人而异. It also changes over time.
- If a 4-hour workday is best for you, cool.
- If a 10-hour workday is your jam, awesome.
- If next week you need a day off, great.
Do what works best for you.

### 年会

[年关将至，"年会“可不要说成“year meeting"](https://www.toutiao.com/i6782352501594128899/)
year meeting?
annual meeting？ # 每年的任何时间，可能是年初，年中或是年末
年末：end of year， end-of-year, year-end
- throw a party: 举行派对（最常见）
- hold a party: 举行派对
- host a party: 主持派对

正确说法：end of year party/ end-of-year party/ year-end party

Would you like to join our end of year party? 您愿意参加我们公司的年会吗？
有的公司年会规模很大，像一个盛会一样。 这种叫：
Gala:ˈ[ɡalə] 庆典， 盛会

- Spring Festival Gala： 春晚
- end of year/end-of-year/year-end bonus:年终奖
- end of year/end-of-year school activity/ year-end school activity:年终学校活动
- end of show music/end-of-show music:节目尾曲

示例
- "Do you want to drink something " 不是 “你想喝什么饮料”
- "to drink something"理解为“喝点什么”，但老外会把它认为是 “喝点什么酒”。因为在英文里， "drink"除了“饮用”还指“含酒精的饮料”
- "Would you like something to drink?" 划重点，这里"something to drink"表达的是“喝什么饮料”
- "Do you want to drink something? Whiskey or tequila?"   “想喝点什么酒吗？威士忌还是龙舌兰？”
- "Take a seat while I get you something to drink."  “请坐，我去给你拿点喝的。”

### 6个迹象表明你的工作环境“有毒”

【2021-12-30】[6个迹象表明你的工作环境“有毒”](https://m.haiwainet.cn/ttc/3541083/2021/1229/content_32306276_1.html) 6 signs you have a toxic workplace

1. There’s an abject lack of communication 缺乏沟通
  - Improper communication means that people are often scattered or confused about expectations from leadership. Projects may seem complicated, stressful and difficult to execute either because there aren't enough hands on deck, or there are too many people who want to take the reins.
  - 沟通不善意味着员工往往会是一盘散沙，或者弄不清领导想要什么。项目可能会显得复杂、压力重重，也会难以执行，或者是因为人手不够，或是因为人人都想发号施令。
2. Gossip culture is prevalent 八卦文化盛行
  - In addition to spreading false info, gossip can lead to cliques forming, which consequently means there’s an exclusionist culture in place. People can lose their jobs, arguments arise more quickly and the office vibe becomes more Mean Girls. Not good.
  - 除了散播假消息，八卦还会导致拉帮结派，在公司内部形成排外文化。人们可能会因此而丢掉工作，同事间争吵频发，办公室氛围会变得像电影《贱女孩》里演的那样。不是什么好事。
3. There’s no room for growth 没有成长空间
  - We all do our best work when we know it counts for something. But if you’re working for a company that’s stuck in their decades-old routine and is resistant to new ideas, you can easily feel stifled. If you can’t pitch new ideas or improve upon your skillset, that may be one sign. It’s also good to take stock of the people you work with and evaluate whether or not they’ve grown. If you notice that your cubicle mate has been in an assistant position for three years, yet she knows the business in and out, you may just be working for a company that doesn’t support progression.
  - 当我们知道努力有意义的时候，我们都会做到最好。但如果你就职的公司墨守成规，拒绝新理念，就很容易让你产生窒息的感觉。如果你不能提出新想法或提升自己的技能，这也许就是个“中毒”迹象。你也可以观察你的同事，评估他们是否得到了成长。如果你注意到你的某个同事已经在助理岗位待了三年，而她早就对业务了如指掌，你所在的公司可能根本不支持员工晋升。
4. You can’t create a work-life balance 你无法达到工作和生活的平衡
  - If your boss demands that your job come before your boyfriend’s birthday or Dad’s visit from Chicago a la Devil Wears Prada, then yes, you’re in a toxic workplace. Of course, it’s important to give your all from nine to five (or whatever your prescribed work hours). But if you’re constantly receiving emails, text messages or phone calls during your days off, and can’t make plans with your loved ones because you may have to hop in a meeting, it’s time to reconsider.
  - 如果你的老板像《穿普拉达的女王》里演的那样，要求你把工作放在第一位，哪怕是男友生日或父亲从外地来看你也不例外，那么你的工作环境确实有毒。当然，上班时间全力以赴很重要，但是如果你在下班之后还不断地收到电子邮件、短信或接到电话，或因为要随时准备开会而无法和爱人约会，那么你是时候该重新考虑一下了。
5. Employees are unmotivated 员工没有动力
  - If managers are not communicating, not giving their employees room to grow and not compensating them appropriately for their hard work, odds are, morale is low. That can mean none of the old employees are willing to help new hires assimilate, everyone only interacts with members on their team and no one is willing to step up and do double duty during peak seasons. This may happen not just because there’s no incentive to go above and beyond your daily duties, but also because everyone is already juggling so much, there’s literally no room to add anything else to their plates.
  - 如果主管不沟通、不给员工成长空间，对他们的辛苦劳动也没有给予足够的回报，那么士气低落是很正常的。这可能意味着老员工不愿帮助新员工融入集体，每个人都只和自己团队里的人交流，没有人愿意在旺季主动承担双重任务。这不仅是因为晋升无望、多干没回报，也可能因为每个人手头的活儿已经满额，再多的话根本做不了。
6. There’s high turnover 人员流动率很高
  - One tell-tale sign that something is wrong within the workplace is when employees come and go at breakneck speed. With so many people (especially millennials) prioritizing their wellness and mental health, no one is going to want to stay in a place that disrupts that. So, if you find that your co-workers are dropping like flies, it’s wise to analyze the culture.
  - 人员流动率很高是工作环境有毒的一个警示。现如今人们（尤其是千禧一代）都很看重自己的身心健康，没有人愿意待在一个摧残身心的地方工作。所以，如果你发现同事们纷纷离职，你应该审视一下这里的工作文化是否有问题。

How to Cope with a Toxic Work Environment

如何应对有毒的工作环境

Unhappy as you may be at your job, leaving is not always an option. So, if you find yourself having to put up with toxic work culture, there are a few things you can try to make your experience better.

尽管你可能干得不开心，但是你也无法说走就走。所以，如果你发现自己不得不忍受有毒的工作文化，你可以通过下面的做法来让自己感觉好一点。

For one, you can take a stab at building a circle of trusted co-workers, people you know will help you reach your goals and won’t bring any unnecessary drama your way. You can also create boundaries—whether that’s letting people know you’re not into the gossip or making it clear that your personal time is not for work. Above everything else, make sure that you keep your professionalism and remain kind to people, hard as it may be. After all, it’s easy to get sucked into petty gossip or low morale, but staying focused on your long-term goals, upkeeping your work ethic and treating people well will never go out of style. (Just don’t be afraid to simultaneously update that resume.)

首先，你可以和信任的同事建立社交圈，他们能帮助你达到你的目标，又不会给你找事儿。其次，划清界限，包括和八卦的人划清界限，或者划清上班和下班时间的界限。最后也是最重要的一点是，尽管很艰难，但一定要保持专业性，始终待人友善。陷入八卦和消沉的泥沼很容易，但是你要知道，朝着长期目标努力、保持职业道德和善待他人永远不会错。（与此同时要更新你的简历，迈出勇敢的一步。）

### 裁员

【2022-10-4】It's starting
- Heard from an ex-colleague（前同事） who is L7 at META
- Every director（主管） and above is given a target（目标） to reduce staff by 10%-15%. If they meet 15% and keep the productivity（生产力） alive then raise（晋升） for some directors.
- Employees will start receiving emails on **improvement plan**（改进计划，pip，裁员通知） along with an option to resign（期权退出） starting next week.
- RIP META.F*** ZUCK.

#### 裁员表达方式

（1）job cuts 缩减工作，就是裁员
- 比如，drastic job cuts 暴力裁员
- 例子：IBM draws criticism for job cuts. IBM因裁员而招致批评。
- When the company decided to make a biggest **job cuts** how we protect ourself and how we required a new job quickly to promise ourself living quality.
- British royal navy job cuts. 英国皇家海军裁员。
- Drastic job cuts only lead to employee's mood deasters.

（2）dismiss
- dismissal wage遣散费，dismissal reason解雇理由，dismmissal pay遣散费，dismmissal(N)

解雇：这种一般是因为你做错事而被解雇了
- 例子：In consequence of your bad work I am forced to dismmiss you.由于你的工作很糟，我不得不把你解雇！
- He has been dismmissed from his job for incompetence.他因无法胜任工作而被解职。
- I tried to dismmiss him from her mind.我试图把他忘掉。
- It was difficulty decision for her to dimissed from his job because of the company was in a financial crisis.

（3）downsize 裁员，精简
- downsize your workforce精简人数，downsize your company 实行公司裁员
- 例子：Sales have decreased so much that they need to downsize. 销售业绩减少很多，所以他们必须缩少规模。
- The company choose to downsize and more fully utilize the remaining workers. 公司决定缩小规模，并更加充分地用好余下的工人。

#### 公司邮件

Dear Peter,
- We had been **trying our every effort**（竭尽全力） to keep all of our employees during this hard period of reorganization. Unfortunately, this is not the case.（情况不是这样的，不管用）
- It is with deep regret（/rɪˈɡret/，懊悔，对...抱歉） that I must inform you of the recent decision to terminate your association with our company（终止劳务合同）. Recent financial problems have forced us to **scrutinize**（/ˈskruːtənaɪz/
，仔细查看） our **manpower resources**（人力资源） carefully and therefore, several employees have, been unfortunately dismissed（开除，解散） in the process. Wish you a rather promising future!

Faithfully yours,

ABC Company

#### 员工回复

Dear Manager,

I am shocked by your notice. I have been here for six years and always work hard, never being late and idling（游手好闲） . It is unfair（不公平） for you to treat an old employee in this way. I hope you will reconsider your decision.

I'm sorry that our company is **under this hard situation**（经营状况不佳）, it is a **tough time** for you to go through. I can fully understand it. However, I feel it quite unfair to be dismissed since I have worked for you for more than ten years and it is hard to get a new job elsewhere at my age. I hope you can take my stand point and reconsider your decision.

I am looking forward to your early reply.

　　Peter
